there is a payload you can use, the payload is "dotdotpwn.txt" 

the "target.txt" file already has domains in it if you want to test, but you can edit the file and put your own targest in the target text. it will ask the file you want to use to scan which is the target.txt file, or you can use an ip address or single domain name.
